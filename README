This is the VillainROM (HTC Hero aftermarket ROM)
over-the-air (OTA) update application.

It consists of a service and a GUI. The service
periodically checks that updates are available, and
puts a notification for user.

The application displays the list of updates
available, and updates them. We support two
kinds of update formats:

- *.zip is the classic com.google.android.update-script
  based update, and is applied via reboot to recovery.

- *.ota is a zip package which contains instructions
  on how to apply it online. The zip is decompressed
  somewhere, and the package structure contains a
  update.sh at its root, which gets executed.

  If the update.sh exits with return code 0, it
  has been successfully applied. Any other return
  code means failure. For this reason, update scripts
  should preferably start with "set -e" to make them
  abort on first error.
